## About Page Builder

Page Builder (aka Beaver Builder) is the drag and drop plugin incorporated into our WordPress theme. 

:link: [Documentation](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/)

Page Builder allows site admins and editors to build pages by dragging pre-built rows and modules.

#### Rows vs Modules
**Rows** are generally a collection of different types of content that occupy a full width row on a page.

**Modules** are things like buttons, paragraphs, images, headers, videos. Basically all of the content you can add to a row.

#### How to launch Page Builder from the WP Page/Post editor

1. Create a new page in WordPress.
2. In the WordPress editor you will see two tabs aboce the WYSIWYG Editor. One titled "Text Editor" and one titled "Page Builder".![images/launch_pb.png](images/launch_pb.png)
3. Click the "Page Builder" tab to launch Page Builder.![images/pb_opening.png](images/pb_opening.png)
4. When you create a new Page Builder page you have the option of starting the page using a Layout Template. If you want to start with a blank page just click "cancel" to dismiss the Layout Template modal.
5. Add content to the page by clicking one of the tabs in the right siderail.![images/pb_siderail.png](images/pb_siderail.png)
  1. **Row Layouts** - Contains a selection of rows with different numbers of columns with set widths.
  2. **Basic Modules** - Contains basic content types you can drag into rows to start adding content. Examples are Headings (to great `<h1></h1>`, etc... headings), Photo, HTML (window you can write html code into), Text Editor (WYSIWYG editor), Video content.
  3. **Advanced Modules** - Lots of different types of modules. You can add a post listing of site post content, add a contact form, embed a map, add a menu to a page.
  4. **Saved Rows** - Contains pre-built rows. Any row you build for a page can be saved and re-used as a saved row.
  5. **Saved Modules** - Contains pre-built module content. Any part of a page builder row can be saved as a module and re-used as a saved module.
