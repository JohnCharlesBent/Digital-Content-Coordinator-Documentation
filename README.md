# Digital Content Coordinator Information

This repository contains markdown files that provide a roadmap to the various projects that currently fall under the Digital Content Coordinator role at Providence Public Library. I've tried to be as clear and detailed as possible about web projects, tools used, locations of files and other assets, and any other helpful information I can provide.

## Table of Contents

### :notebook: AskRI.md
Information about the theme set-up, custom functionality and hosting used for [AskRI.org](https://askri.org).

### :notebook: ProvLib.md
Information about the theme set-up, custom functionality, hosting, plugins used and other infomration about [ProvLib.org](https://provlib.org).

### :notebook: ProvLibDigital.md
An overview of the Library's digital repository [ProvLibDigital.org](https://provlibdigital.org). This document mainly lays out the broad strokes of the site theme and islandora theme overrides in the PLD Drupal theme. Documentation for Islandora / ISLE, Amazon AWS, and ingest process are all contained in individual markdown files.

### :notebook: Islandora-and-ISLE.md
Contains general information about Islandora to get someone new to the Islandora platform started. Also contains information about ISLE and Docker (the application deployment tool we use to port our Islandora repo from local to production development). This file contains lots of links to documentation I found helpful while working on this platform. Given the spotty nature of Islandora documentation this should hopefully save some web-surfing time :surfer: :surfer: :surfer: and point towards answers to common Islandora/ISLE/Docker questions.

### :notebook: LibCal.md
Information about the third party system we currently use for the Library's event calendars. This file also contains an overview of the in-house plugin that displays events on ProvLib.org and ways that plugin could be improved, should you feel so inclined.

### :notebook: Digital-Collections-Info.md
Documents the status of archiving already digitized collections. Includes locations of digitized master files for colletions both on servers in PPL and on external HDs.  Also contains links to metadata spreadsheets made with Metadata transformer that contain technical metadata about each collection and info about the tools Data Accession, Metadata Transformer, and Bagger. Somone with an archivists/library sciences background will probably find the info about Archival Information tools redundant.

**I hope this information proves to be useful.**
